   journal={A Prospective Study of Facilitators and Barriers},
   year=2020,
   abstract= { As we all know, digital health applications have grown increasingly abundant. Many apps provide health monitors that keep track of peoples health rate,
   blood pressure and blood glucose. Additonally, patients are able to access their health information at the palm of their hands. However, for the low income populations
   these benefits are not easily accessable. The issues can consist of unavaliable elctronics, limited understanding of health terminology, lack of empowerment and mistrust 
   of health services. The research enrolled patience that had access to a smart device. They deduced from the reasearch that many patients (1/5th) did not use the application 
   at the end of the study, commummucationn varried and should be chosen by preference and the aid of Community Health Workers had pushed users to stay persistent.

   abstract= { The growth of electronics such as smart phones have rose in quality and in quantity. Mobile phones have become abundant with many capabilities ranging 
   from quick communication and access to large databases of information at the click of a button. This article focuses on the integration of these smart mobile device and 
   vast area of health care. Mobile phones are capable of voice/text messages, file transfer, photo capability, location-determination and location based services. Current 
   mobile phones provide homebased patient monitoring or webbased programs for easxzy health monitoring. They can be used to count calories, health reminders, and
   patient monitoring of heart rate, or blood pressure. The issues of growth in movile use in healthcare can consist of untimely use of the mobile phone and network or
   secruity issues. However, with the growth in modern day applications and device capabilities, the costs of such devices become lower and more efficient and can be adujusted
   to combat issues.

   hardware limitations, expensive data usage, connectivity issues, limited interaction possibilities. Mobile applicatiosn allowed for quick communication between parties. 
   It allowed users to save time and increase productivity with the ability to set reminders, check emails from any time and place. Mpobile applications opened up new job 
   opportunities for app developers. Mobile applications make entertainment readily accessable. However, mobile applications has their cons. They have small screens, lack of windows,

   journal={A CASE STUDY OF USING MOBILE APPLICATION INSTAGRAM},
   year= 2016,
   abstract= { The rise in popularity of emerging mobile technology has created many scenarios that are both good and bad. Students are bringing mobile devices into
   the classroom and may become a distraction. Unwanted scenarios may take place when a teacher tries to take the device away or tell the students to put them away. Teachers
   have combined lessons with technology in order to combat this in a educational manner. The case study focuses on the use of the application Instagram to teach English
   to foreign language learners. Instagram allows the student to learn English through social interactions, 30 second videos that can be paused to focus on the speaker, 
   and intriguing user interface that will motivate the user to learn and enjoy English. The study concludes that it was very beneficial in learning English. The participants 
   took a pre and post test from before and after using the mobile device. They were able to use the pause and replay function while watching a video to answer 
   English Comprehension questions.

   informal and lifelong, and learning and teaching support. The importance of technology is based on the portability, social interactivity, context sensitivity,
   connectivity and individuality. The size and weigh of the electronic allows for it to be used in or out of the classroom. Tehcnology gives students the ability to exchange data
   with other students and share their ideas and thoughts. This collaborative learning allows students to understand topics at a deeper level. Technology allows for research and
   can formulate scenarios to teach students global awareness. The use of technology has the ability to cater a students learning based on their own skill level.},
